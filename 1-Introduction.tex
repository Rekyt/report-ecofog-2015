Functional Ecology $\rightarrow$ Functional Traits

Importance of Functional Traits to understand Ecological Niche

Multidimensional Niche (Hutchinson), Competitive Exclusion, Environmental Filtering

Importance of all axes to have good view of ecological strategies

Diameter Growth \& Tropical Forests $\rightarrow$ French Guiana Context

Several growth models created, used $\rightarrow$ estimate growth using measured traits

Generally consider traits as specific, all individuals of the same species sharing an average trait

However, there is trait variability, intra-specific variability. What importance does it have? To what extent is it important to consider it? 

Being different from mean species trait $\rightarrow$ importance?
