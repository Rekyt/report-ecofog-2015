\subsection*{Data Provenance}

\subsubsection*{Growth Data}
The nine plots used through this article,
Guyafor network, plots,
French Guiana, map. Several sites
Longitudinal data.

Followed over tens of years. Diameters were measured at breast height (~1.3m), during the following period we had Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) values for each tree.

Due to various inconsistency of followed year. Choose a common time period between plots. To estimate Annual Growth Rate (AGR), we regressed DBH over years, taking the slope of the regression as the AGR.

\subsubsection*{Trait Data}

<<<<<<< HEAD
Bridge database, traits measured in Baraloto, \citep{baraloto_functional_2010, baraloto_decoupled_2010}.

\subsection*{Growth model}

Linear mixed-model explaining annual growth rate. With plot and species random effect.

Extracted residuals from above model.

\subsection*{Data analysis}

Used R, ggplot2, lmer, dplyr, MuMin for R2 for mixed-models.
