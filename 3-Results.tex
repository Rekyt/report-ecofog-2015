Explain pattern of variability, underlines importance of species effect for growth and trait \missfig

However, species effect can't explain everything, tested for spatial auto-correlation.

Then, compared different growth models.

Examined link of predicted AGR with such model and distance to species average.

Black lines are equal-AGR lines over the surface. For traits detail see~\autoref{tab:seltraits}.}
