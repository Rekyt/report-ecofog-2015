\section*{Results}

We partitioned variance due to the species effect, i.e. the part of the variance explained by the species of individuals (see~\autoref{fig:aov}). Depending on the trait, the species effect could explain between 27\% up to 75\% of the variability of our data. While species effect can explain over 75\% of the variability in wood density, it only explains less than 30\% of the variability in AGR.

To test how growth was affected by individual traits we made growth mixed-model for each one of them (see~\autoref{tab:seltraits} for traits and~\autoref{tab:growth_mod} for models) as predictors of the AGR. Based on the adapted R-squared for mixed-models~\citep{nakagawa_general_2013}, we selected the best model for each trait (see~\autoref{tab:growth_mod}).

For all traits models with distance measures were better than model with only species average term. But for wood density and SLA, hierarchical distances model performed as well as indvidual's trait models. By adding a distance term to the species average term model, we gained in predictive power, shown by the increase of condition R-squared between models.

For bark thickness the absolute distance model improved the conditional R-squared by 0.025 compared to the model with only species average trait. For wood density hierarchical distance model improved the R-squared by 0.056 (10\% of total $\text{R}^2$) compared to species average model. While for SLA hierarchical distance model only increased $\text{R}^2$ by 0.004. For laminar chlorophyll and toughness the hierarchical distance models gained 0.001 of R-squared compared to the species average term models.

Using the best models (in bold in~\autoref{tab:growth_mod}) that included a distance term we predicted AGR for a range of individual trait values and species average values. To underline the interplay between intra- and inter-specific variabilities we plotted the centered species average trait value vs. the hierarchical distance of indivdual's (see~\autoref{fig:simul}). We obtained AGR "landscapes", that show the pattern of variations of variation as a function of individual and species trait variation. Depending on the trait we had different patterns, for SLA and wood density we had similar patterns: the larger the species average trait value, the lower the AGR, and the higher the individual hierarchical distance the lower the AGR. For example, an increase of $10\text{cm}^2.\text{g}^{-1}$ in SLA species average decreases the growth by $0.035\text{mm}.\text{yr}^{-1}$ while the same increase in hierarchical distance decreases the AGR by $0.02\text{mm}.\text{yr}^{-1}$. For laminar chlorophyll content we observe that increasing species average as well as increasing hierarchical distance lead to increasing AGR. While for leaf toughness, species average and hierarchical AGR gradients are opposed: an increase in species average decreases AGR, and an increase individual hierarchical distance increases AGR. Because the best model for bark thickness was an absolute distance model, we observe the symmetrical patterns of AGR variations for change in hierarchical distance: globally, the higher the hierarchical distance the lower the AGR, while the higher the species average, the lower the growth.

		\caption{\textbf{Summary table of tested trait-specific growth models.} We modeled radial growth using linear-mixed model, all models contained plot and species random effects, as well as DBH and $\log\text{DBH}$ terms to take growth curve shape into account~\citep{herault_functional_2011}. Then, for each trait, we added a fixed effect that contained different terms: \textbf{Species Avg.}, only the species average trait value; \textbf{Hierarchical Distance}, the species average plus the difference between individual trait and species average; \textbf{Absolute Distance}, the species average plus the absolute difference between individual trait and species average; \textbf{Individual Trait}, only the trait value of individuals. Models indicated in \textbf{bold} are those with the highest logarithmic likelihood per trait.}
