\section*{Authors Contributions and Acknowledgments}

M. Grenié ran the analyses and wrote the manuscript. B. Hérault provided the data. Both B. Hérault and R. Gaspard supervised and advised the project.
I would like to thank the EcoFOG lab in Kourou, and especially everybody in the modeling team corridor, for providing an amazing work atmosphere!
